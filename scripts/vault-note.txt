Potentially bad practice, but it's useful to make a backup script for 
unsealing the hashicorp vaults with its unseal tokens. The vaults seal on 
reboot and must be unsealed within a couple of minutes of the pod starting,
otherwise it'll restart the pod and you'll have to do it again. Once a vault
is sealed, there's no way to get the tokens again, so you should make a backup
of them somewhere secure just in case you accidently seal the vault.
